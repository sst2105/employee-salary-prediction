Step-by-Step Procedure
Phase 1: Data Collection and Exploration
Step 1: Dataset Acquisition

Obtain the Adult Census Income dataset (also known as "Census Income" dataset)
Dataset contains 48,842 instances with 14 attributes
Target variable: Income (>50K or ≤50K)

Step 2: Data Exploration

Load dataset using pandas
Examine dataset structure, shape, and basic statistics
Identify data types and missing values
Analyze target variable distribution

Phase 2: Data Preprocessing
Step 3: Data Cleaning

Handle missing values represented as '?' in categorical columns
Replace missing values with 'Others' or most frequent category
Remove irrelevant columns (e.g., 'fnlwgt' - final weight)
Filter out inconsistent data entries

Step 4: Feature Engineering

Remove rows with very low education levels (1st-4th, 5th-6th, Preschool)
Eliminate non-working categories (Without-pay, Never-worked)
Standardize categorical value formats

Step 5: Data Encoding

Apply Label Encoding to categorical variables:

workclass, education, marital-status, occupation
relationship, race, sex, native-country


Encode target variable (income) to binary format (0: ≤50K, 1: >50K)
Store encoders for future use in predictions

Step 6: Feature Scaling

Apply StandardScaler to normalize numerical features
Ensure all features have mean=0 and standard deviation=1
Prevent features with larger scales from dominating the model

Phase 3: Model Development
Step 7: Train-Test Split

Split dataset: 80% training, 20% testing
Use stratified sampling to maintain class distribution
Set random_state=42 for reproducibility

Step 8: Model Training
Train five different machine learning algorithms:
a) Logistic Regression

Linear classification algorithm
Good baseline model for binary classification
Parameters: max_iter=1000, random_state=42

b) Random Forest Classifier

Ensemble method using multiple decision trees
Handles non-linear relationships well
Parameters: n_estimators=100, random_state=42

c) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Instance-based learning algorithm
Classifies based on similarity to neighboring points
Parameters: n_neighbors=5

d) Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Finds optimal hyperplane for classification
Effective for high-dimensional data
Parameters: random_state=42, probability=True

e) Gradient Boosting Classifier

Sequential ensemble method
Builds models iteratively to correct previous errors
Parameters: n_estimators=100, random_state=42

Phase 4: Model Evaluation
Step 9: Performance Assessment

Calculate accuracy score for each model
Generate confusion matrices
Create classification reports (precision, recall, F1-score)
Compare model performances

Step 10: Model Selection

Identify best-performing model based on accuracy
Validate results using cross-validation
Analyze feature importance (for applicable models)

Phase 5: Web Application Development
Step 11: Streamlit App Creation

Design user-friendly interface
Create input forms for employee attributes
Implement single prediction functionality
Add batch prediction capability for CSV uploads

Step 12: Model Integration

Save trained models using joblib
Load models in Streamlit application
Implement prediction pipeline with preprocessing

Phase 6: Deployment
Step 13: Local Testing

Test Streamlit app locally
Validate all input combinations
Ensure error handling works properly

Step 14: Cloud Deployment

Deploy on Streamlit Cloud or similar platform
Configure environment requirements
Test deployed application functionality
